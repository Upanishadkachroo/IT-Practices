Local swimmer Sarah Jennings shattered the world record in the 200-meter freestyle event at the Olympic trials yesterday. Her time of 1 minute and 53.02 seconds secures her spot on the national team for the Paris games. Coach Mark Davison praised her intense training regimen, saying, "Sarah has worked relentlessly for this moment. We knew the potential was there, but seeing her execute a perfect race was truly inspiring." The final competition will take place next month.
