The Manchester City team suffered a stunning defeat to the underdog Falcons FC in yesterday's highly anticipated cup final, losing 3-2 after a penalty shootout. The game remained deadlocked 2-2 through extra time, but City's two crucial missed penalties sealed their fate. Manager Pep Guardiola accepted responsibility for the loss, citing a lack of clinical finishing in the final third. Falcons goalkeeper, David Romero, was named Man of the Match after making three decisive saves.
