The President signed the landmark Environmental Protection Act into law this morning, marking a major milestone for climate legislation. The act allocates $50 billion toward renewable energy research and mandates stricter emissions standards for industrial factories starting next year. Critics from the energy sector warn that the new regulations could lead to a temporary increase in consumer costs, but supporters argue the long-term benefits to public health and the economy far outweigh the risks.
